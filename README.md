How do I use this again??

Create your own "help" files on a per-directory basis.

# Quick Start
Clone this repo and then run
```
./install.sh
```
Which will create a symlink to your home directory and will update your .bashrc for you.

Then just go to some directory and
```
mkwtf
```
Your editor of choice will open (if not you need to set the `EDITOR` environment variable in your `~/.bash_profile`) and you can write your notes. Then you can view your notes by being in the same directory and asking
```
wtf
```
